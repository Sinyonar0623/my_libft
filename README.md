###

<p align="left">This project involves creating a custom C library (libft), which I developed to replicate standard C functions. The purpose of this is to gain a deeper understanding of how these functions work, while also enhancing my logic and problem-solving skills. A major focus of the project is memory management, particularly identifying and resolving memory leaks.</p>

###

Throughout this project, I’ve been learning to work with data structures, such as linked lists, and have customized the library with additional functions tailored to my specific needs. The code is compiled using `cc` with the flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` to handle errors and warnings rigorously. I have also created a Makefile for efficient code management and compilation.</p>

###

<p align="left">I’ve written custom header files and used Valgrind to check and fix memory leaks during development. The project is built on Ubuntu 24, with Vim as my primary IDE.</p>
